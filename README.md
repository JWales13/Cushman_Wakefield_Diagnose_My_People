# Cushman & Wakefield: Diagnose My People
Diagnose My People is a full stack web application that helps Cushman & Wakefield clients/decision makers survey their people and tabulate their feedback into visualized data that is used to make informed decisions in purchasing a new workspace.  Clients of Cushman & Wakefield can go to the website and are provided with the opportunity to build a custom-tailored survey that is used to gather employee data on the categories that matter to them.  Once the survey has been created, Cushman & Wakefield will reach out to the clients and provide them with a custom URL and passcode for the survey that the client will email their employees.  When the survey period is over, the data is compiled into an eye-catching and user-friendly dashboard.  Cushman & Wakefield uses this information to better serve and make recommendations to clients and show them properties that resemble what the survey suggests.  This results in happier people with more buy-in and loyalty to their employer.

# Next Steps
Features that you would like to add at some point in the future.

[  ] Admin Dashboard View - Feature- Comment Section connect
[  ] Admin Dashboard View - Feature-Heatmaps

### Adding a Map Feature to Diagnose My People:

Get a Google Maps API key for Cushman & Wakefield. Follow the link below.
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

Add Google Maps API using the Database method to save user information.
The link below is a step-by-step tutorial. This link will also give instruction on creating a new SQL table, which will need to be JOINED with the client table.
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/info-windows-to-db

It is recommended to place the Map display in the survey.html view above the first          ng-repeat.

The results will need a GET request to display on the dashboard. Google Maps API can display the results in a heatmap. The link below details heatmaps and other ways to display the data.

# Heroku Deployment

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a Cloud Application Platform that allows users to publishapps to the web.

## Summary Steps

### Heroku Prerequisite

1. Sign up for an account on [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/)
2. Install Heroku CLI by typing `brew install heroku` in Terminal
3. Authenticate by typing `heroku login` in Terminal

> Note: Your project also needs to have a git repository.

### Heroku Setup

Before you deploy, make sure your server `port` is configured correctly as:

```JavaScript
var port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
```

Run the following commands from within your project folder.

1. In terminal, navigate to your project folder and type `heroku create`
2. Login in if prompted
3. Type `git remote -v` to ensure it added successfully
4. In terminal, type `git push heroku master`
5. Our website is now live! However... we also have a database

### Postgresql on Heroku

1. In terminal, type `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev` to set up Postgresql on your Heroku project
2. Next, type `heroku pg:push your_database DATABASE_URL` to copy your database contents up to Heroku. `your_database` is the actual name of your database (e.g. `koala_holla_`). `DATABASE_URL` is a heroku config variable created by the Add On. Do not replace it with something else, just type: `DATABASE_URL`. For example, if you were deploying the `koala_holla` database, you should type `heroku pg:push kaola_holla DATABASE_URL`
3. Update or create a module for your pg-pool configuration to the following code that will convert the heroku `DATABASE_URL` into a pool config object. The only line you should have to change is `database: process.env.DATABASE_NAME || 'your_database'`. Change `your_database` to the actual name of your database. (e.g. `database: process.env.DATABASE_NAME || 'koala_holla'`:

**modules/pool.js**

```JavaScript
/**
* You'll need to use environment variables in order to deploy your
* pg-pool configuration to Heroku.
* It will look something like this:
**/

var pg = require('pg');
var url = require('url');
var config = {};

if (process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  // Heroku gives a url, not a connection object
  // https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-pool
  var params = url.parse(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  var auth = params.auth.split(':');

  config = {
    user: auth[0],
    password: auth[1],
    host: params.hostname,
    port: params.port,
    database: params.pathname.split('/')[1],
    ssl: true, // heroku requires ssl to be true
    max: 10, // max number of clients in the pool
    idleTimeoutMillis: 30000, // how long a client is allowed to remain idle before being closed
  };

} else {
  // only change the things on the right side of the ||
  config = {
    user: process.env.PG_USER || null, //env var: PGUSER
    password: process.env.DATABASE_SECRET || null, //env var: PGPASSWORD
    host: process.env.DATABASE_SERVER || 'localhost', // Server hosting the postgres database
    port: process.env.DATABASE_PORT || 5432, //env var: PGPORT
    database: process.env.DATABASE_NAME || 'your_database', //env var: PGDATABASE or the name of your database (e.g. database: process.env.DATABASE_NAME || 'koala_holla',)
    max: 10, // max number of clients in the pool
    idleTimeoutMillis: 30000, // how long a client is allowed to remain idle before being closed
  };
}

module.exports = new pg.Pool(config);
```

When you need a pool, use the following code:

```JavaScript
var pool = require('../modules/pool.js');
```

Next, commit your changes and push them to Heroku:

```
git add .
git commit -m "MESSAGE"
git push heroku master
```

> Note: You'll need to commit and push each time you make a change that you want to deploy to Heroku. Automatic deployments are covered in [a later section](#gui-and-automatic-deployment) **Keep in mind you CAN NOT pull from Heroku. This is not a replacement for GitHub!**

Lastly, open terminal and type `heroku open`, which should show you your deployed site!

> Note: It is best to fully test your code locally before deploying to Heroku. Bugs are much harder to troubleshoot on a live website.

### Miscellaneous

- `heroku logs` - Display error logs
- `heroku config` - Show basic app info
- `heroku restart` - Sometimes it helps to turn things off an on again
- `heroku open` - Opens the website for you project in the browser

## GUI and Automatic Deployment

The [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) website GUI can simplify several of the steps taken above especially for projects where you intend to make future changes.

1. In [your list of Heroku apps](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), select your application.
2. Under the `Deploy` tab, in the `Deployment Method` section, select `Github`. Connect to the `Github` repository with your application by searching for the name of your repository.
3. In the `Manual Deploy` section, click `Deploy Branch` to deploy for the first time.

## Connect Postico to your Heroku Database

If you would like to edit  database, connect to your Heroku database directly from Postico. 

1. In [your list of Heroku apps](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), select your application.
2. Under `Resources` or in the `Configure Add-Ons` section, select `Heroku Postgres`.
3. Select the `Settings` tab and click `View Credentials`
4. Open Postico and select `New Favorite`.
5. In the new Postico favorite, update the following to match Heroku:
  - Host
  - User
  - Database
  - Password
  - Port
6. Click `Connect` and you should have access to your database directly from Postico!
