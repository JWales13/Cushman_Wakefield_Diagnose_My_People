# Cushman & Wakefield: Diagnose My People
‘Diagnose My People’ is a full stack web application that helps Cushman & Wakefield clients put their employees first as they’re calculating their commercial real estate needs.  Clients of Cushman & Wakefield can go to the website and are provided with the opportunity to build a custom-tailored survey that will be used to gather employee data based on 8 different categories.  Once the survey has been created, Cushman & Wakefield will reach out to the client and will provide them with a custom URL and passcode for the survey that the client can email to their employees.  Once the survey period is over, the data is compiled into an eye-catching and user-friendly dashboard.  Cushman & Wakefield can then set up a time to go over the results with the client and show them properties that are not only in their price-range, but also include the spatial, lifestyle and location preferences of employees.  This results in happier people with more buy-in and loyalty to their employer.
